/**
*Prompt the user to enter the second  number
*/

Display "Enter the second number:"
Input second number

/**
*Prompt the user to enter the third number
*/

Display "Enter the third number:"
Input third number

/**
*Calculate the sum of the three numbers
*/

sum = first number + second number + third number

/**
*Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3 (number of inputs)
*/
average = sum / 3

/**
*Display the result
*/

Display "The average of", first number, ",", second number, "and", third number, "is", average.
