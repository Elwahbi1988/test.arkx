Exercise 9:
Write a program that reads in 7 different numbers, then prints out the smallest value and also prints out the position of the smallest value in the input sequence as a number from 1 to 7.


/**
*Initialize variables to store the smallest value and its position
*/
smallest = infini
smallest position = 0

/**
*Read in 7 different numbers from the user
*/
for i from 1 to 7:
/**
*Prompt the user to enter a number
*/
    Display "Enter number ", i, ":"
    Input number

/**
*Check if the number is smaller than the current smallest value
 */

if number < smallest :
        smallest  = number
        smallest position = i

/**
*Display the smallest value and its position
*/
Display "The smallest is:", smallest
Display "Its position in the input sequence is:", smallest position
