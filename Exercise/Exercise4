##Exercise 4: 

Write pseudocode for a program that finds the maximum number among three given numbers and displays it

/**
*Prompt the user to enter the first number
/*

Display "Enter the first number:"
Input first number

/**
*Prompt the user to enter the second number
/*

Display "Enter the second number:"
Input second number

/**
*Prompt the user to enter the third number
/*

Display "Enter the third number:"
Input third number

/**
*Assume the first number is the maximum
/*

max number = first number

/**
*Compare the second number with the current maximum
*/

if second number > max number:
    max number = second number

/**
*Compare the third number with the current maximum
/*

if third number > max number:
    max number = third number

/**
*Display the maximum number
/*

Display "The maximum number among", first number, ",", second number
