Exercise 8: 
Write pseudocode for a program that takes a list of numbers as input and displays the sum of all the positive numbers in the list.


/**
*Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces
*/

Display "Enter a list of numbers (separated by spaces):"
Input numbersList

/**
*Split the input string into individual numbers
*/
numbers = Split numbers list by ' '

/**
*Initialize a variable to hold the sum of positive numbers
*/

Sum positive = 0

/**
*Loop through each number in the list
*
for each number in numbers

/**
*Convert the number from string to a numerical value
*/

num = Convert number to numerical value
    
 /**
 *Check if the number is positive
 */
  
  if num > 0:

/**
*Add the positive number to the sum
*/       

Sum Positive = Sum Positive + num

/**
*Display the sum of positive numbers
*/

Display "The sum of positive numbers is:", Sum positive
